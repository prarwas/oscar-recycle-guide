# oscar-recycle-guide
Created a project called "Oscar's Guide to Recycling" with the use of Python and the pandas library on with Google's Colab. The project begins by asking the user what type of item they wish to dispose of. Once that is known, the project initiates a series of questions until the user knows which bin the items goes in, if they should donate the items, or if they should resell them. Essentially, Oscar's Guide to Recycling teaches people the importance of recycling as well as the many resources around them.
